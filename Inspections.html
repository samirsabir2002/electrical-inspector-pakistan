        <p>
            Insulation Testing Survey as required under Rule-63 of the Local Electricity Rules-1937 is conducted on Shutdown and Off Load. The megger testing is to be carried-out on four different locations i.e on Load Side, DB’s Side, LT Panel Side & finally on
            HT Side of the Transformer, and subsequently the measurement records are given below;

        <h2>Cable Load Capacity, Leakage & DB Schedule on Full Load:</h2>
        <p>
            Current studies used to be carried out on full load for cables, circuit breakers and Leakage Current Survey is also conducted during the audit and the measurement records are given below in DB’s schedules survey, which are less than 1/5000 part of total
            current passing permissible under Rule-26 of the Local Electricity Rules, Hence leakage current measured at DBs boxes and LT Panels & Earth pits is within the recommended limits and satisfactory. Cable current load survey has been conducted
            during the audit in order to ensure the optimum loading of electrical cables. During measurement of cable loading it was seen that all the cables loading are within the recommended limit and found satisfactory. Further a few circuit breakers
            found overloaded and heat up as in classification of NCR’s.

        <h2>Inspection by Infrared Thermography Imaging Survey:</h2>
        <p>
            Thermography survey is to be conducted at the organization with the help of Infrared Thermal Camera (FLIR USA Exclusive Model E8, Image Quality is 320x240=76800 Pixels, sensitivity 0.06-250*C). This model is a professional tool top of the line of Executive
            Series of E4, E5, E6 & E8. This tool captures thermal images as well as digital images instantly at the same time simultaneously i.e picture in picture. Thermography is an advance technique for the preventive maintenance as it will determine
            the hot spot generated in the electrical system due to lose cable connection, overloading of the cable and CB’s, insulation damage etc. Apart from identifying the heating zone within the electrical system this survey also shows exposed cables,
            looping connections, ignorance of terminal lugs, improper tapping of joints, cable twisting and cable color coding etc via digital image picture in picture of thermal image.

        <h2>Summary efficiency Audit Report with Graph % age comparison:</h2>
        <p>The percentage share of all determined by above calculations comparing efficiency of both compressors installed at two different locations i.e KIA & SITE Area, it is seen that Compressor is 13.55 % & 4.29 % more efficient than PPCO’s Local Compressor
            respectively. The observations calculated above are also demonstrated in the graphic chart below. This will help management to understand the existing level energy consumed by both compressors. Hence the organization, if desired, can take
            the necessary targeted action towards improvement of energy efficiency and conservation accordingly.<br>As above based on Summary Graph, there is BLUE color is a base line percentage, RED color is the output value line for Morgan’ Kirloskar
            Compressors in Blocks/KWh, similarly YELLOW color is the output value line for PPCO’ Local Compressors in Blocks/KWh, whereas GREEN color indicates the efficiency deference of compressors over PPCO’s Local compressors. The difference of efficiency
            in both locations is due to many abnormal factors like supply interruption, variation in voltages, quality of motors, drums, water, salt, competency of operators, ON/OFF intervals, ignorance of ice hardness etc. </p>
